# CS3210 Assignment 1

## How to compile
Make sure you have gcc with OpenMP support.

Then, just run:

```bash
make
```

### How to run
```bash
./sim
```

### Sample input files
You might want to use our sample input testcases in `input/` directory.

Run it like so:
```bash
./sim < input/input1
./sim < input/input2
./sim < input/input3
```

We have run these 3 input files, and the output is stored in the `output/`
directory.
